## Class 11 : Stack and Queue

[Back to main](https://github.com/Raghdsmadi/data-structures-and-algorithms) 
******************************************
## Challenge

Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue.


***************************************************

## Approach & Efficiency

Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.

Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
