## Class 15 : Trees

[Back to main](https://github.com/Raghdsmadi/data-structures-and-algorithms) 
******************************************
## Challenge

Create a Binary Search Tree class
This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
Add
Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.

Create a Binary Tree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
pre order
in order
post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.


*******************************************************************************

## Approach & Efficiency

1- pre_order : 
 o(n) for time and space complexity

2- in_order :
o(n) for time and space complexity 

3- post_order :
o(n) for time and space complexity

4- add  o(log(n)) for time  , o(1) for space

4- contains
 o(log(n)) for time , o(1) for space
