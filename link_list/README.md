## Class 05 : Linked_List

[Back to main](https://github.com/Raghdsmadi/data-structures-and-algorithms) 
******************************************

## Challenge

Create two classes for creating singly linked lists and nodes.
Add functions that can append, insert,includes, and print nodes from a linked list. 

---

## Approach & Efficiency

I created node class which takes a value of any type as an argument and have a pointer(next) ==None as default.
I also created linked_list class which takes no arguments and create an empty linked list. 

## class linked list has these methods :
- ***insert(self, value)***:

    This function inserts a value at the (beginning) of the linked list <br>



- ***includes(self, value)***:

    This function checks if the provided value is in the linked list or not and return a Boolean
<br>


- ***append(self, value)***:

    This function inserts a value (Node instance) at the (end) of the linked list <br>


<br>


- ***ToString(self)***:

   This function represents the Linked List as string that has all its nodes
