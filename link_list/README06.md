## Class 06 : Linked_List

[Back to main](https://github.com/Raghdsmadi/data-structures-and-algorithms) 
******************************************

## Challenge

Add functions that can append, insert before and insert after 

---

## Approach & Efficiency

I created 3 methods inside class linked list  the first one called append to add a node in the last of linked list
the second method is to adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified
and the last method is to adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

## class linked list has these methods :
- ***insertBefore(self, value, newValue)***:

    to adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified



- ***insertAfter(self, value,newValue)***:

   adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified
<br>


- ***append(self, value)***:

    This function inserts a value (Node instance) at the (end) of the linked list <br>
