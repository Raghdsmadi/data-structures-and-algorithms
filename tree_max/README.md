## Challenge
Find the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.
*************************************
## Approach & Efficiency
Big-O is o(n) for time because the recursive internal function, and o(1) for space because we only created one variable to hold the max value
